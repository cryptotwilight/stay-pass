This is the Stay Pass repository 

Stay Pass is an exciting new Hotel Stay programme that enables a traveller to stay at different hotels on different chains using NFTs. In this age of digital nomads users want flexible travel and hotels want the ability to manage the commercial risk of that flexiblity. Hence hotels can use NFTs that immediately transfer stay ownership hence locking in inventory revenue. But what if a traveller needs to switch hotels enter Stay Pass. Stay Pass allows a traveller to swap hotel NFTs across different blockchains using the Hyper Lane Protocol allowing the traveller the ultimate flexibility in ownership.
